# Taxonomy

This project aims to the classification of technical documents in the engineering consultancy sector.
The idea employed is that the different disciplines (e.g Mechanical, Electrical, Hydraulic engineering) will
include specific language for the engineering report and this will be used to classify the documents in their disciplines according to
the content. 
This project is driven by the necessity to create an automated document classification system and save time and 
labour costs in archiving the documents.

_Techniques used_: NLP, clustering with k-Means, principal component analysis, EDA, data visualisation, feature engineering
